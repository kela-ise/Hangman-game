Hangman Game
This is a simple word-guessing game implemented in C#. The game selects a random word from a predefined list,
and the player must guess the word one letter at a time.

Features

Random word selection from a predefined list.

Input validation to ensure only single alphabetic characters are entered.

Prevents duplicate guesses.

Displays the current progress of the guessed word.

Provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.

Tracks the number of attempts left.

Goals

Improve user engagement through an interactive and educational word game.

Enhance C# programming skills by implementing game logic and input validation.

Development Status

The project is currently in a basic functional stage.

Future improvements are planned (see TODO section).

Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration

Why does it exist?

This project was developed to practice fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, list handling, and user input validation in C#.

Comparison with Other Projects

Unlike other Hangman implementations, this version is lightweight, console-based, and focuses on clear input validation and user interaction.
